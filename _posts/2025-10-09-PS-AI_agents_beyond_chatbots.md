# Paper Spotlight: *Beyond DNS*

This week's arXiv paper spotlight features the paper **‚ÄúBeyond DNS: Unlocking the Internet of AI Agents via the NANDA Index and Verified AgentFacts‚Äù** by *Ramesh Raskar (MIT), Pradyumna Chari (MIT), John Zinky (Akamai), Sichao Wang (CISCO), Rekha Singhal (TCS), and colleagues* (2025).  

The paper imagines what the Internet might look like once AI agents become full participants rather than background tools. Instead of browsing websites, agents will find and verify one another, such as trading data, negotiating tasks, and forming dynamic collaborations. The authors propose a new digital backbone to support this shift, combining a **global agent directory (NANDA Index)** with **verifiable credentials (AgentFacts)** to make the agent economy transparent and secure.

## Overview

The authors argue that the Internet as we know it, built around the Domain Name System (DNS), is no longer sufficient for a world where autonomous AI agents discover, verify, and collaborate with one another. **DNS allows humans to find web resources, but what if the users of the future Internet are not humans, but AI agents acting on our behalf?**

This paper proposes a bold reimagining of the Internet‚Äôs architecture to enable a trustworthy, verifiable ‚ÄúInternet of Agents.‚Äù The team introduces two central innovations:

- **The NANDA Index (Network Agent Name and Discovery Architecture)** ‚Äì a discovery system for AI agents.
- **Verified AgentFacts** ‚Äì a standardized system for verifying identity, capability, and provenance of AI agents.

## The NANDA Index: A ‚ÄúDNS‚Äù for AI Agents

Where DNS resolves human-friendly names (like *mit.edu*) into IP addresses, the NANDA Index resolves agent identities into functional metadata, such as what the agent does, who built it, and how it‚Äôs verified.

Agents can query the NANDA Index to find others with particular capabilities (e.g., ‚Äúfind a legal contract summarizer with a verified compliance certification‚Äù).
This infrastructure allows discovery by semantics and trust level, not just by name, a critical step for safe, autonomous coordination.

## Verified AgentFacts: Establishing Trust in a World of Machines

To prevent a chaos of unverifiable AI activity, the authors propose AgentFacts, a verifiable registry of facts about agents ‚Äî cryptographically signed metadata such as:

- Ownership and version history
- Training data provenance
- Compliance with ethical or regulatory standards
- Security and runtime attestations

The concept draws parallels with SSL certificates, but for AI entities: a trust layer that underpins accountability, reputation, and traceability across the agent ecosystem.

## How It Works: Architecture in Action

The paper outlines a multi-layered architecture:

1. Registration Layer ‚Äì where developers register AI agents with unique IDs and metadata.
2. Verification Layer ‚Äì integrating attestation services (using technologies like blockchain or verifiable credentials).
3. Discovery Layer (NANDA Index) ‚Äì enabling intelligent search and matchmaking among agents.
4. Interaction Layer ‚Äì supporting verified agent-to-agent communication.

These layers together form the foundation for a ‚Äúnetwork of verified agents‚Äù, where trust and discovery are built into the infrastructure itself.

## Why It Matters

AI ecosystems are growing rapidly, but today‚Äôs interactions are largely opaque and fragmented. The authors warn that without verification, malicious or spoofed agents could cause misinformation, fraud, or security breaches at machine speed.

By proposing a protocol-level solution, they aim to make agent ecosystems transparent and auditable, extending Internet governance into the AI era. For example, imagine two financial AI agents verifying each other before executing trades.

This could:

- Enable safe economic transactions between autonomous agents.
- Support cross-platform interoperability of AI services.
- Build human trust in agent-driven automation.

## Broader Vision: The Internet of Verified Agents

Ultimately, the paper envisions a future where agents operate as first-class Internet citizens - discoverable, verifiable, and interoperable.

The ‚ÄúInternet of AI Agents‚Äù would resemble a living ecosystem of digital entities collaborating under shared rules of trust, verification, and accountability.

## Takeaway

**Beyond DNS** presents a compelling roadmap for building the next evolution of the Internet ‚Äî one designed for intelligent, autonomous systems rather than just human users. It brings together **technical infrastructure**, **governance principles**, and **social responsibility** into a unified proposal for the era of ubiquitous AI. In the auathors' words, *‚Äúif DNS gave names to websites, NANDA gives trust to agents.‚Äù*
